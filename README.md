# Recipe_Scraper_Project
Not sure what to make for dinner? Input the ingredients you have!

During my Student Exchange Program, I came up with this fun side project to tackle a problem I often face: deciding what to cook with the ingredients I have on hand. I love cooking for my friends and family, but sometimes the sheer amount of options can be overwhelming. This became even more of an issue when I was abroad, surrounded by a fridge full of unfamiliar ingredients. 

This python program takes user inputs and searches BBC Food Network for recipes containing the ingredients input by the user. This code is the skeleton for future developments. I intend to include more websites with more recipes, a spelling error corrector using fuzzywuzzy, and an approximate match feature.
